## 🏗️ System Architecture
WordWise follows a layered architecture with a clear separation of concerns.
Below is a visual representation of the system architecture:

![WordWise System Architecture](https://iili.io/3Un4Jup.png)


- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
- **Data Access Layer** (`Entity Framework Core`)
- **Business Logic Layer**
- **API Layer** (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
- **Client Applications**
- **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT + Identity)
- **Caching Layer** (In-memory for API key control)
- **AI Integration Layer** (Gemini AI)

> Follows the standard Controller → Service → Repository pattern.
